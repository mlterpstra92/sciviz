\section{Divergence}
We implemented the divergence visualisation. We have chosen to implement this as the central difference in the $x$-direction (or $d_x$) as well as the $y$-direction ($d_y$). We have chosen this because this is more stable than the forward or backward difference. The divergence can then be calculated as $\nabla \cdot d = d_x + d_y$.
