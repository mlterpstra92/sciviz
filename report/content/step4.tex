\section{Divergence}
\label{sec:divergence}
We implemented the divergence visualisation.
We have chosen to implement this as the central difference in the $x$-direction (or $d_x$) as well as the $y$-direction ($d_y$).
We have chosen this because this is more stable than the forward or backward difference.
The divergence can then be calculated as $\nabla \cdot d = d_x + d_y$.
